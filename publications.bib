	abstract = {Recent experiments on similarly shaped polymer microcavity lasers show a dramatic difference in the far-field emission patterns. We show, for different deformations of the ellipse, quadrupole and hexadecapole, that the large differences in the far-field emission patterns are explained by the differing ray dynamics corresponding to each shape. Analyzing the differences in the appropriate phase space for ray motion, it is shown that the differing geometries of the unstable manifolds of periodic orbits are the decisive factors in determining the far-field pattern. Surprisingly, we find that strongly chaotic ray dynamics is compatible with highly directional emission in the far field.},

Correlating static and dynamic excitation and emission data with the size and charge of available lattice sites suggests that two types of Bi0-species, each located on one of the two available Ba2+ lattice sites, are responsible for {NIR} photoemission. This is further confirmed by the absence of {NIR} emission in polycrystalline {Ca2P2O7:Bi} and {Sr2P2O7:Bi.} Excitation is assigned to transitions between the doubly degenerated ground state {4S3/2} and the degenerated excited levels {2D3/2}, {2D5/2} and {2P1/2}, respectively. {NIR} emission is attributed to {2D3/2→4S3/2.} The {NIR} emission center can coexist with Bi2+ species.

This phenomenon has a rather general nature, equally applicable to sound and all other waves. It enables resonators of unique properties attractive both in science and engineering. Very high quality factors of optical WGM resonators persisting in a wide wavelength range spanning from radio frequencies to ultraviolet light, their small mode volume, and tunable in- and out- coupling make them exceptionally efficient for nonlinear optical applications. Nonlinear optics facilitates interaction of photons with each other and with other physical systems, and is of prime importance in quantum optics. In this paper we review numerous applications of WGM resonators in nonlinear and quantum optics. We outline the current areas of interest, summarize progress, highlight difficulties, and discuss possible future development trends in these areas.},

Future quantum information networks will require coherent microwave-to-optical conversion to link electronic quantum processors and memories via low-loss optical telecommunication networks. Efficient conversion can be achieved with electro-optical modulators operating at the single microwave photon level. In the standard electro-optic modulation scheme, this is impossible because both up- and down-converted sidebands are necessarily present. Here, we demonstrate true single-sideband up- or down-conversion in a triply resonant whispering gallery mode resonator by explicitly addressing modes with asymmetric free spectral range. Compared to previous experiments, we show a 3 orders of magnitude improvement of the electro-optical conversion efficiency, reaching 0.1\% photon number conversion for a 10 GHz microwave tone at 0.42 mW of optical pump power. The presented scheme is fully compatible with existing superconducting 3D circuit quantum electrodynamics technology and can be used for nonclassical state conversion and communication. Our conversion bandwidth is larger than 1 MHz and is not fundamentally limited.},

The radial mode numbers q and the angular mode numbers p = ℓ-m are identified and labeled via far-field imaging. The polar mode numbers ℓ are determined unambiguously by fitting the frequency differences between individual whispering gallery modes ({WGMs}). This allows for the accurate determination of the geometry and the refractive index at different temperatures of the {WGMR}. For future applications in classical and quantum optics, this mode analysis enables one to control the narrow-band phase-matching conditions in nonlinear processes such as second-harmonic generation or parametric down-conversion.},

We analyze the collective emission from a thermal gas and from a jet of atoms. In both cases, the line shape of a high-order harmonic exhibits a narrow spike with spectral width that is determined by the bandwidth of the driving laser. Finally, we discuss a scheme for producing long-duration laser hot spots with intensity in the range of the intensity threshold for high-harmonic generation. In the proposed scheme, the hot spot is produced by a long laser pulse that is consecutively coupled to a high-quality micro-resonator and a metallic nano-antenna.

	abstract = {Optical whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators are a powerful and versatile tool in many branches of science. Fine-tuning of the central frequency and linewidth of individual resonances is, however, desirable in a number of applications, including frequency conversion, optical communications, and efficient light–matter coupling. To this end we present a detailed theoretical analysis of dielectric tuning of WGMs supported in axisymmetric resonators. Using the Bethe–Schwinger equation and adopting an angular spectrum field representation, we study the resonance shift and mode broadening of high-Q WGMs when a planar dielectric substrate is brought close to the resonator. Particular focus is given to use of a uniaxial substrate with an arbitrarily aligned optic axis. Competing red and blue resonance shifts (∼30  MHz), deriving from generation of a near-field material polarization and back action from the radiation continuum, respectively, are found. Anomalous resonance shifts can hence be observed depending on the substrate material, whereas mode broadening on the order of ∼50  MHz can also be realized. Furthermore, polarization-selective coupling with extinction ratios of {\textgreater}104 can be achieved when the resonator and substrate are of the same composition and their optic axes are chosen correctly. Double refraction and properties of outcoupled beams are also discussed.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a detailed description of the optical coupling into a Whispering Gallery Mode (WGM) resonator through a prism via frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) is presented. The problem is modeled as three media with planar interfaces and closed expressions for FTIR are given. Then, the curvature of the resonator is taken into account and the mode overlap is theoretically studied. A new analytical expression giving the optimal geometry of a disc-shaped or ring-shaped resonator for maximizing the intra-cavity circulating power is presented. Such expression takes into consideration the spatial distribution of the WGM at the surface of the resonator, thus being more accurate than the currently used expressions. It also takes into account the geometry of the prism. It is shown an improvement in the geometry values used with the current expressions of about 30\%. The reason why the pump laser signal can be seen in experiments under critical coupling is explained on this basis. Then, the conditions required for exciting the highest possible optical power inside the resonator are obtained. The aim is to achieve a highly-efficient up-conversion of a THz signal into the optical domain via the second-order nonlinearity of the resonator material.},

In such experiments, independent control of in-coupling and out-coupling rates to different modes can lead to higher conversion efficiencies and greater flexibility in the generation of nonclassical states based on parametric down-conversion. In this work, we introduce a scheme that enables selective out-coupling of WGMs belonging to a specific polarization family, while the orthogonally polarized modes remain largely unperturbed. Our technique utilizes material birefringence in both the resonator and the coupler such that a negative (positive) birefringence allows for polarization-selective coupling to TE (TM) WGMs. We formulate a refined coupling condition suitable for describing the case where the refractive indices of the resonator and the coupler are almost the same, from which we derive a criterion for polarization-selective coupling. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate our proposed method using a lithium niobate disk resonator coupled to a lithium niobate prism, where we show a 22-dB suppression of coupling to TM modes relative to TE modes.},

Such a system is more compact and allows for longer poling periods as well as lower losses in the crystal. Filtering the pump radiation by a rubidium-87 vapor cell allowed the frequency-angular spectra to be obtained down to ∼0.5 THz or ∼1 nm shift from the pump radiation line. The presence of an amplified spontaneous emission “pedestal” in the diode laser radiation spectrum significantly hampers the observation of spontaneous parametric down-conversion spectra, in contrast to conventional narrowband gas lasers. Benefits of switching to longer pump wavelengths are pointed out, such as collinear optical-terahertz phase-matching in bulk crystals.},

The need for cryogenic systems increases the cost and complexity of the instruments, hindering the development of, among others, airborne and space applications. In this work, the nonlinear parametric upconversion of millimeter-wave radiation to the optical domain inside high-quality (Q) lithium niobate whispering-gallery mode (WGM) resonators is proposed for ultra-low noise detection. We experimentally demonstrate coherent upconversion of millimeter-wave signals to a 1550\&\#x00A0;nm telecom carrier, with a photon conversion efficiency surpassing the state-of-the-art by 2 orders of magnitude. Moreover, a theoretical model shows that the thermal equilibrium of counterpropagating WGMs is broken by overcoupling the millimeter-wave WGM, effectively cooling the upconverted mode and allowing ultra-low noise detection. By theoretically estimating the sensitivity of a correlation radiometer based on the presented scheme, it is found that room-temperature radiometers with better sensitivity than state-of-the-art high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT)-based radiometers can be designed. This detection paradigm can be used to develop room-temperature instrumentation for radio astronomy, earth observation, planetary missions, and imaging systems.},

For a high fidelity microwave to optical transducer, efficient conversion at single photon level and low added noise is needed. Currently, the most promising approaches to build such systems are based on second-order nonlinear phenomena such as optomechanical and electro-optic interactions. Alternative approaches, although not yet as efficient, include magneto-optical coupling and schemes based on isolated quantum systems like atoms, ions, or quantum dots.

Under particular conditions, we observe the cascaded generation of several sidebands around the pump—the first steps of optical frequency comb generation via cavity-enhanced second-harmonic generation.},

	abstract = {Photon pairs and heralded single photons, obtained from cavity-assisted parametric down conversion (PDC), play an important role in quantum communications and technology. This motivated a thorough study of the spectral and temporal properties of parametric light, both above the optical parametric oscillator (OPO) threshold, where the semiclassical approach is justified, and deeply below it, where the linear cavity approximation is applicable. The pursuit of a higher two-photon emission rate leads into an interesting intermediate regime, between above OPO threshold and very low pump power, where the OPO still operates considerably below the threshold but the nonlinear cavity phenomena cannot be neglected anymore. Here, we investigate this intermediate regime and show that the spectral and temporal properties of the photon pairs, as well as their emission rate, may significantly differ from the widely accepted linear model. The observed phenomena include frequency pulling and broadening in the temporal correlation for the down-converted optical fields. These factors need to be taken into account when devising practical applications of the high-rate cavity-assisted spontaneous PDC sources.},

	abstract = {Microwave photonics lends the advantages of fiber optics to electronic sensing and communication systems. In contrast to nonlinear optics, electro-optic devices so far require classical modulation fields whose variance is dominated by electronic or thermal noise rather than quantum fluctuations. Here we demonstrate bidirectional single-sideband conversion of X band microwave to C band telecom light with a microwave mode occupancy as low as 0.025±0.005 and an added output noise of less than or equal to 0.074 photons. This is facilitated by radiative cooling and a triply resonant ultra-low-loss transducer operating at millikelvin temperatures. The high bandwidth of 10.7MHz and total (internal) photon conversion efficiency of 0.03\% (0.67\%) combined with the extremely slow heating rate of 1.1 added output noise photons per second for the highest available pump power of 1.48 mW puts near-unity efficiency pulsed quantum transduction within reach. Together with the non-Gaussian resources of superconducting qubits this might provide the practical foundation to extend the range and scope of current quantum networks in analogy to electrical repeaters in classical fiber optic communication.},

We show in particular how the mode frequencies of a lithium niobate whispering-gallery-mode resonator are shifted by planar substrates—of refractive indices ranging from 1.50 to 4.22—contacting the resonator rim. Both blue- and redshifts are observed, as well as an increase in mode linewidth, when substrates are moved into the evanescent field of the whispering gallery mode.

The energy of photons in the gigahertz domain is too low to allow transmission through the noisy room-temperature environment, where the signal would be lost in thermal noise. Optical photons, on the other hand, have much higher energies, and signals can be detected using highly efficient single-photon detectors. Transduction from microwave to optical frequencies is therefore a potential enabling technology for quantum devices. However, in such a device the optical pump can be a source of thermal noise and thus degrade the fidelity; the similarity of input microwave state to the output optical state. In order to investigate the magnitude of this effect we model the sub-Kelvin thermal behavior of an electro-optic transducer based on a lithium niobate whispering gallery mode resonator. We find that there is an optimum power level for a continuous pump, whilst pulsed operation of the pump increases the fidelity of the conversion.},

Quantum effects are most pronounced in the region immediately above the semi-classical pumping threshold, where our numerical results differ significantly from semi-classical predictions.

These favorable characteristics of Ti:sapphire have given rise to femtosecond lasers and optical frequency combs. Shaping a single Ti:sapphire crystal into a millimeter sized high quality (Q) whispering gallery mode resonator (Q ≈ 108) reduces the lasing threshold to 14.2 mW and increases the laser slope efficiency to 34\%. The observed lasing can be both multi-mode and single-mode. This is the first demonstration of a Ti:sapphire whispering-gallery laser. Furthermore, a novel method of evaluating the gain in Ti:sapphire in the near infrared region is demonstrated by introducing a probe laser with a central wavelength of 795 nm. This method results in decreasing linewidth of the modes excited with the probe laser, consequently increasing their Q. These findings open avenues for the usage of whispering gallery mode resonators as cavities for the implementation of compact Ti:sapphire lasers. Moreover, Ti:sapphire whispering-gallery laser can also be utilized as an amplifier inside its gain bandwidth by implementing a pump–probe configuration.},

We demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that this nonlinear interaction can be harnessed for useful expansion of the soliton frequency comb via the formation of a secondary idler comb. We explore the physics of the process, showing that the phase detuning of the injected probe from a cavity resonance plays a key role in setting the central frequency of the idler comb, thus providing a convenient parameter through which to control the spectral envelope of that comb. Our results elucidate the dynamics that govern the interactions between dissipative Kerr cavity solitons and externally injected probe waves, and could prove useful in the design of future Kerr frequency comb systems by enabling the possibility to provide high-power comb lines in a specified spectral region simply through the injection of a suitably chosen probe.},

	abstract = {Parametric oscillation in Kerr microresonators provides an attractive pathway for the generation of new optical frequencies in a low-power, small-footprint device. The frequency shift of the newly generated parametric sidebands is set by the phasematching of the underlying four-wave-mixing process, with the generation of large frequency shift sidebands typically placing exacting requirements on a resonator\&\#x2019;s dispersion profile. In practice, this limits the range of viable pump wavelengths, and ultimately the range of output frequencies. In this paper, we consider a multimode four-wave-mixing process in which the pump and sidebands propagate in different mode families of the resonator. We show that this multimode configuration yields a considerable relaxation in the phasematching requirements needed to generate large frequency shift parametric sidebands, allowing their formation even in resonators with strong second-order dispersion. Experimentally we use a magnesium-fluoride micro-disk resonator to demonstrate this multimode phasematching. By accessing different pump and sideband modes, four distinct multimode parametric processes generating frequency shifts between 118 and 216 THz are reported. The resulting separation between the two sidebands is almost three octaves.},

	abstract = {Optical microresonators offer a highly-attractive new platform for the generation of optical frequency combs. Recently, several groups have been able to demonstrate the generation of dual-frequency combs in a single microresonator driven by two optical pumps. This opens the possibility for microresonator-based dual-comb systems suitable for measurement applications such as spectroscopy, ranging and imaging. Key to the performance of these systems are the parameters of the radio-frequency comb spectrum that arises from the interference of the two optical combs. In this work, we present a simple mechanism to enable the discrete fine-tuning of these parameters by driving the two optical combs with optical pumps with different azimuthal mode numbers. The mechanism consists of tuning the difference in azimuthal mode number between the two pumps by selection of the pumps\&\#x2019; frequencies. We are able to implement this technique when the two counter-propagating pumps are set to drive resonances of the same spatial mode family, as well as different mode families. In each case, we experimentally observe \&\#x223C;1 MHz of discrete tunability in the line-spacing of the radio-frequency comb as the frequency offset between the two pumps is scanned between 0 to 80 free-spectral-ranges.},

	abstract = {In this work, we analyze the first whispering gallery mode resonator (WGMR) made from monocrystalline yttrium lithium fluoride (YLF). The disc-shaped resonator is fabricated using single-point diamond turning and exhibits a high intrinsic quality factor (Q) of 8×108. Moreover, we employ a novel, to the best of our knowledge, method based on microscopic imaging of Newton\&\#x2019;s rings through the back of a trapezoidal prism. This method can be used to evanescently couple light into a WGMR and monitor the separation between the cavity and the coupling prism. Accurately calibrating the distance between a coupling prism and a WGMR is desirable as it can be used to improve experimental control and conditions, i.e., accurate coupler gap calibration can aid in tuning into desired coupling regimes and can be used to avoid potential damage caused by collisions between the coupling prism and the WGMR. Here, we use two different trapezoidal prisms together with the high-Q YLF WGMR to demonstrate and discuss this method.},
