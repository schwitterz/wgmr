abstract: Microresonator based dual frequency combs offer an integrated photonic solution
  to a wide range of technological challenges, including spectroscopy, range finding,
  material characterization and hyperspectral imaging. These applications require
  a high level of mutual coherence between combs, but achieving such stability can
  be demanding. Here we experimentally demonstrate that comb generation exploiting
  the rich structure of the nonlinear electro-optic tensor in lithium niobate can
  generate ultra-stable dual combs, with the two combs naturally having orthogonal
  polarizations. We theoretically explore the application of our technique to dual
  frequency comb generation from the far infrared (IR) to the ultraviolet (UV). Our
  combs have relative linewidths as low as ~400 Î¼Hz, and require no stabilization
  or post-processing methods.
