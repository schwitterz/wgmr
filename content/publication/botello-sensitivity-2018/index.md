abstract: Conventional ultra-high sensitivity detectors in the millimeter-wave range
  are usually cooled as their own thermal noise at room temperature would mask the
  weak received radiation. The need for cryogenic systems increases the cost and complexity
  of the instruments, hindering the development of, among others, airborne and space
  applications. In this work, the nonlinear parametric upconversion of millimeter-wave
  radiation to the optical domain inside high-quality (Q) lithium niobate whispering-gallery
  mode (WGM) resonators is proposed for ultra-low noise detection. We experimentally
  demonstrate coherent upconversion of millimeter-wave signals to a 1550&#x00A0;nm
  telecom carrier, with a photon conversion efficiency surpassing the state-of-the-art
  by 2 orders of magnitude. Moreover, a theoretical model shows that the thermal equilibrium
  of counterpropagating WGMs is broken by overcoupling the millimeter-wave WGM, effectively
  cooling the upconverted mode and allowing ultra-low noise detection. By theoretically
  estimating the sensitivity of a correlation radiometer based on the presented scheme,
  it is found that room-temperature radiometers with better sensitivity than state-of-the-art
  high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT)-based radiometers can be designed. This
  detection paradigm can be used to develop room-temperature instrumentation for radio
  astronomy, earth observation, planetary missions, and imaging systems.
