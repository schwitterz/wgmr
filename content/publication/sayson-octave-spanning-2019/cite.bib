 abstract = {Through degenerate Kerr four-wave mixing in ultrahigh-Q crystalline microresonators made of magnesium fluoride, tunable conversion of a compact, low-power telecommunications laser over an entire optical octave from 1,083nm to 2,670nm, with signatures of mid-infrared sidebands at almost 4,000nm, is shown.},
