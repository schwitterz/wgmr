abstract: It has been predicted and experimentally demonstrated that by injecting
  squeezed light into an optomechanical device, it is possible to enhance the precision
  of a position measurement. Here, we present a fundamentally different approach where
  the squeezing is created directly inside the cavity by a nonlinear medium. Counterintuitively,
  the enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio works by deamplifying precisely the
  quadrature that is sensitive to the mechanical motion without losing quantum information.
  This enhancement works for systems with a weak optomechanical coupling and/or strong
  mechanical damping. This can allow for larger mechanical bandwidth of quantum-limited
  detectors based on optomechanical devices. Our approach can be straightforwardly
  extended to quantum nondemolition qubit detection.
