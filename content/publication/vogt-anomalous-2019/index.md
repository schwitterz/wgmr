abstract: The vast majority of resonant systems show a red-shift for the resonance
  frequency when a perturbation, e.g.,&#x00A0;losses, is introduced to the system.
  In contrast, here we report for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the
  experimental demonstration of both red- and anomalous blue-shifting of whispering-gallery
  modes (WGMs) using dielectric and metallic substrates. The maximum blue-shift is
  more than three times as large as the expected red-shift, proving that the anomalous
  blue-shift is more than a peculiar curiosity. The experiments are performed in the
  terahertz frequency range with coherent continuous-wave spectroscopy. The results
  establish dielectric and metallic tuning as a novel and viable approach to tune
  high-quality WGMs and provide valuable insights into the anomalous blue-shift of
  WGM cavity systems. The tuning capabilities for these compact monolithic resonators
  are of significant interest for fundamental science and technological applications
  alike.
