abstract: We report on prism coupling of high-quality (high-Q) terahertz (THz) whispering-gallery
  modes (WGMs) in spherical high resistivity float zone grown silicon (HRFZ-Si) resonators
  over two octaves from 0.2 THz to 1.1 THz. The WGMs are excited using a HRFZ-Si prism
  and show unprecedented quality factors of up to 2.2 &#x000D7; 104. A detailed discussion
  of the phase-and mode-matching criteria of the prism coupling scheme implemented
  in the continuous wave THz spectroscopy system is presented. The results provide
  numerous opportunities for passive ultra-broadband high-Q devices operating in the
  THz frequency range.
