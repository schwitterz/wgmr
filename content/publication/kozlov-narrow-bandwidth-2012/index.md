abstract: We predict and investigate the emission of high-order harmonics by atoms
  that cross intense laser hot spots that last for a nanosecond or longer. An atom
  that moves through a nanometer-scale hot spot at characteristic thermal velocity
  can emit high-order harmonics in a similar fashion to an atom that is irradiated
  by a short-duration (picosecond-scale) laser pulse. We analyze the collective emission
  from a thermal gas and from a jet of atoms. In both cases, the line shape of a high-order
  harmonic exhibits a narrow spike with spectral width that is determined by the bandwidth
  of the driving laser. Finally, we discuss a scheme for producing long-duration laser
  hot spots with intensity in the range of the intensity threshold for high-harmonic
  generation. In the proposed scheme, the hot spot is produced by a long laser pulse
  that is consecutively coupled to a high-quality micro-resonator and a metallic nano-antenna.
  This system may be used for generating ultra-narrow bandwidth extreme-ultraviolet
  radiation through frequency up-conversion of a low-cost compact pump laser.
