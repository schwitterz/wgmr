abstract: Optical microresonators offer a highly-attractive new platform for the generation
  of optical frequency combs. Recently, several groups have been able to demonstrate
  the generation of dual-frequency combs in a single microresonator driven by two
  optical pumps. This opens the possibility for microresonator-based dual-comb systems
  suitable for measurement applications such as spectroscopy, ranging and imaging.
  Key to the performance of these systems are the parameters of the radio-frequency
  comb spectrum that arises from the interference of the two optical combs. In this
  work, we present a simple mechanism to enable the discrete fine-tuning of these
  parameters by driving the two optical combs with optical pumps with different azimuthal
  mode numbers. The mechanism consists of tuning the difference in azimuthal mode
  number between the two pumps by selection of the pumps&#x2019; frequencies. We are
  able to implement this technique when the two counter-propagating pumps are set
  to drive resonances of the same spatial mode family, as well as different mode families.
  In each case, we experimentally observe &#x223C;1 MHz of discrete tunability in
  the line-spacing of the radio-frequency comb as the frequency offset between the
  two pumps is scanned between 0 to 80 free-spectral-ranges.
