abstract: Microwave photonics lends the advantages of fiber optics to electronic sensing
  and communication systems. In contrast to nonlinear optics, electro-optic devices
  so far require classical modulation fields whose variance is dominated by electronic
  or thermal noise rather than quantum fluctuations. Here we demonstrate bidirectional
  single-sideband conversion of X band microwave to C band telecom light with a microwave
  mode occupancy as low as 0.025Â±0.005 and an added output noise of less than or equal
  to 0.074 photons. This is facilitated by radiative cooling and a triply resonant
  ultra-low-loss transducer operating at millikelvin temperatures. The high bandwidth
  of 10.7MHz and total (internal) photon conversion efficiency of 0.03% (0.67%) combined
  with the extremely slow heating rate of 1.1 added output noise photons per second
  for the highest available pump power of 1.48 mW puts near-unity efficiency pulsed
  quantum transduction within reach. Together with the non-Gaussian resources of superconducting
  qubits this might provide the practical foundation to extend the range and scope
  of current quantum networks in analogy to electrical repeaters in classical fiber
  optic communication.
