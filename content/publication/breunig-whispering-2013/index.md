abstract: Optical whispering gallery modes (WGMs) of mm-sized axisymmetric resonators
  are well localized at the equator. Employing this distinctive feature, we obtain
  simple analytical relations for the frequencies and eigenfunctions of WGMs which
  include the major radius of the resonator and the curvature radius of the rim. Being
  compared with results of finite-element simulations, these relations show a high
  accuracy and practicability. High-precision free-spectral-range measurements with
  a millimeter-sized disc resonator made of MgF2 allow us to identify the WGMs and
  confirm the applicability of our analytical description.
