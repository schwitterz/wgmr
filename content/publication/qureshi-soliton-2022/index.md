abstract: The nonlinear scattering of a linear optical wave from a conservative soliton
  has been widely studied in optical fibers as a mechanism for nonlinear frequency
  conversion. Here we extend this analysis to consider the scattering of an externally
  injected probe wave from a dissipative cavity soliton circulating in a Kerr microresonator.
  We demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that this nonlinear interaction
  can be harnessed for useful expansion of the soliton frequency comb via the formation
  of a secondary idler comb. We explore the physics of the process, showing that the
  phase detuning of the injected probe from a cavity resonance plays a key role in
  setting the central frequency of the idler comb, thus providing a convenient parameter
  through which to control the spectral envelope of that comb. Our results elucidate
  the dynamics that govern the interactions between dissipative Kerr cavity solitons
  and externally injected probe waves, and could prove useful in the design of future
  Kerr frequency comb systems by enabling the possibility to provide high-power comb
  lines in a specified spectral region simply through the injection of a suitably
  chosen probe.
