abstract: Quantum information technology based on solid state qubits has created much
  interest in converting quantum states from the microwave to the optical domain.
  Optical photons, unlike microwave photons, can be transmitted by fiber, making them
  suitable for long distance quantum communication. Moreover, the optical domain offers
  access to a large set of very well-developed quantum optical tools, such as highly
  efficient single-photon detectors and long-lived quantum memories. For a high fidelity
  microwave to optical transducer, efficient conversion at single photon level and
  low added noise is needed. Currently, the most promising approaches to build such
  systems are based on second-order nonlinear phenomena such as optomechanical and
  electro-optic interactions. Alternative approaches, although not yet as efficient,
  include magneto-optical coupling and schemes based on isolated quantum systems like
  atoms, ions, or quantum dots. Herein, the necessary theoretical foundations for
  the most important microwave-to-optical conversion experiments are provided, their
  implementations are described, and the current limitations and future prospects
  are discussed.
