abstract: In the Terahertz (THz) domain, we investigate both numerically and experimentally
  the directional emission of whispering gallery mode resonators that are perturbed
  by a small scatterer in the vicinity of the resonators rim. We determine quality
  factor degradation, the modal structure and the emission direction for various geometries.
  We find that scatterers do allow for directional emission without destroying the
  resonator’s quality factor. This finding allows for new geometries and outcoupling
  scenarios for active whispering gallery mode structures such as quantum cascade
  lasers and passive resonators such as evanescent sensors. The experimental results
  agree well with finite difference time domain simulations.
