abstract: Optical microcavities have attracted tremendous interest in both fundamental
  and applied research in the past few decades, thanks to their small footprint, easy
  integrability, and high quality factors. Using total internal reflection from a
  dielectric interface or a photonic band gap in a periodic system, these photonic
  structures do not rely on conventional metal-coated mirrors to confine light in
  small volumes, which have brought forth new developments in both classical and quantum
  optics. This focus issue showcases several such developments and related findings,
  which may pave the way for the next generation of on-chip photonic devices based
  on microcavities.
