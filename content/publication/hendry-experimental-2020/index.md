abstract: We report on the experimental observation of internally pumped parametric
  oscillation in a high-$!Q$Q lithium niobate microresonator under conditions of natural
  phase matching. Specifically, launching near-infrared pump light around 1060 nm
  into a $ z $z-cut congruent lithium niobate microresonator, we observe the generation
  of optical sidebands around the input pump under conditions where second-harmonic
  generation is close to natural phase matching. We find that a wide range of different
  sideband frequency shifts can be generated by varying the experimental parameters.
  Under particular conditions, we observe the cascaded generation of several sidebands
  around the pump—the first steps of optical frequency comb generation via cavity-enhanced
  second-harmonic generation.
