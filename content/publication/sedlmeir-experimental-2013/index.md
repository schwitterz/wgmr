abstract: 'The usual configuration of uniaxial whispering gallery mode resonators
  is a disk shaped geometry where the optic axis points along the symmetry axis, a
  so called z-cut resonator. Recently x-cut resonators, where the optic axis lies
  in the equatorial plane, became of interest as they enable extremely broadband second
  harmonic generation. In this paper we report on the properties of a more generalized
  system, the so called angle-cut resonator, where the optic axis exhibits an arbitrary
  angle against the symmetry axis. We show experimentally that the modal structure
  and quality factors are similar to common resonators but that the polarization properties
  differ quite significantly: due to the asymmetry the polarization depends on the
  equatorial position and is, in general, elliptical.'
