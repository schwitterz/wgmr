 abstract = {We study lasing emission from asymmetric resonant
cavity GaN microlasers. By comparing far-field intensity patterns
with images of the microlaser we find that the lasing modes are
concentrated on three-bounce unstable periodic ray orbits; i.e.,
the modes are scarred. The high-intensity emission directions of
these scarred modes are completely different from those predicted
by applying Snell's law to the ray orbit. This effect is due to the
process of "Fresnel filtering" which occurs when a beam of finite
angular spread is incident at the critical angle for total internal
reflection.
