abstract: Recent experiments on similarly shaped polymer microcavity lasers show a
  dramatic difference in the far-field emission patterns. We show, for different deformations
  of the ellipse, quadrupole and hexadecapole, that the large differences in the far-field
  emission patterns are explained by the differing ray dynamics corresponding to each
  shape. Analyzing the differences in the appropriate phase space for ray motion,
  it is shown that the differing geometries of the unstable manifolds of periodic
  orbits are the decisive factors in determining the far-field pattern. Surprisingly,
  we find that strongly chaotic ray dynamics is compatible with highly directional
  emission in the far field.
