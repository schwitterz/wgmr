abstract: We report on experiments on refractrometric sensing with crystalline Whispering
  Gallery Mode (WGM) resonators made of magnesium fluoride, which has a refractive
  index that is only slightly larger than that of water (Δn ≈ 0.05). The resulting
  evanescent field of a WGM resonator placed in an aqueous environment penetrates
  therefore deep into the surrounding medium, which makes it a promising candidate
  for sensing applications. We measured a bulk index sensitivity of 1.09 nm/RIU (refractive
  index unit) in a resonator with a radius of R = 2.91 mm and intrinsic Q-factors
  of more than 108 in aqueous environments. Furthermore, we describe the fabrication
  process of crystalline WGM resonators.
