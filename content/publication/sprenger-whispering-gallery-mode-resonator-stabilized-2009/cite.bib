 abstract = {We demonstrate a narrow-line fiber loop laser using erbium-doped fiber as gain material, stabilized by using a microsphere as a transmissive frequency selective element. Stable lasing with a linewidth of 170 kHz is observed, limited by the experimental spectral resolution. A linear increase in output power and a redshift of the lasing mode were also observed with increasing pump power. Its potential applications are discussed.},
