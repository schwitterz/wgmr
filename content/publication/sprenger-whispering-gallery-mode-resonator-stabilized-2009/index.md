abstract: We demonstrate a narrow-line fiber loop laser using erbium-doped fiber as
  gain material, stabilized by using a microsphere as a transmissive frequency selective
  element. Stable lasing with a linewidth of 170 kHz is observed, limited by the experimental
  spectral resolution. A linear increase in output power and a redshift of the lasing
  mode were also observed with increasing pump power. Its potential applications are
  discussed.
