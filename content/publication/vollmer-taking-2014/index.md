abstract: We provide a review on the applications of whispering gallery mode resonators
  in sensing, and biosensing in particular. We highlight the most recent developments
  in this area, which were presented at the 560. WE Heraeus Seminar “Taking Detection
  to the Limit – Biosensing with Optical Microcavities”.
