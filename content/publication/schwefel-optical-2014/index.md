abstract: Lasing is based on the process of optical gain. Once this gain provided
  through external pumping surpasses the loss in a resonator, lasing sets in and a
  coherent beam of laser light is emitted. Thus, loss is a natural adversary of lasing,
  at least in common lasers. A striking amendment to this rule is reported on page
  328 of this issue by Peng et al. (1), who report an onset of lasing in a pair of
  coupled resonators when the total loss of the system is increased.
