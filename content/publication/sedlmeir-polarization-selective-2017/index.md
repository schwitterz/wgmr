abstract: Whispering-gallery mode (WGM) resonators are an important platform for linear,
  nonlinear, and quantum optical experiments. In such experiments, independent control
  of in-coupling and out-coupling rates to different modes can lead to higher conversion
  efficiencies and greater flexibility in the generation of nonclassical states based
  on parametric down-conversion. In this work, we introduce a scheme that enables
  selective out-coupling of WGMs belonging to a specific polarization family, while
  the orthogonally polarized modes remain largely unperturbed. Our technique utilizes
  material birefringence in both the resonator and the coupler such that a negative
  (positive) birefringence allows for polarization-selective coupling to TE (TM) WGMs.
  We formulate a refined coupling condition suitable for describing the case where
  the refractive indices of the resonator and the coupler are almost the same, from
  which we derive a criterion for polarization-selective coupling. Finally, we experimentally
  demonstrate our proposed method using a lithium niobate disk resonator coupled to
  a lithium niobate prism, where we show a 22-dB suppression of coupling to TM modes
  relative to TE modes.
