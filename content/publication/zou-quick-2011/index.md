abstract: In this paper, we developed an efficient method for searching the resonant
  eigenfrequency of dielectric optical microcavities by the boundary element method.
  By transforming the boundary integral equation to a general eigenvalue problem for
  arbitrary, symmetric, and multi-domain shaped optical microcavities, we analyzed
  the regular motion of the eigenvalues against the frequency. The new strategy can
  predict multiple resonances, increase the speed of convergence, and avoid non-physical
  spurious solutions. These advantages greatly reduce the computation time in the
  search process of the resonances. Moreover, this method is not only valuable for
  dielectric microcavities, but is also suitable for other photonic systems with dissipations,
  whose resonant eigenfrequencies are complex numbers.
