abstract: 'We study level crossing in the optical whispering-gallery (WG) modes by
  using toroidal microcavities. Experimentally, we image the stationary envelope patterns
  of the composite optical modes that arise when WG modes of different wavelengths
  coincide in frequency. Numerically, we calculate crossings of levels that correspond
  with the observed degenerate modes, where our method takes into account the not
  perfectly transverse nature of their field polarizations. In addition, we analyze
  anticrossing with a large avoidance gap between modes of the same azimuthal number. '
