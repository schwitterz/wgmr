 abstract = {We study level crossing in the optical
whispering-gallery (WG) modes by using toroidal microcavities.
Experimentally, we image the stationary envelope patterns of the
composite optical modes that arise when WG modes of different
wavelengths coincide in frequency. Numerically, we calculate
crossings of levels that correspond with the observed degenerate
modes, where our method takes into account the not perfectly
transverse nature of their field polarizations. In addition, we
analyze anticrossing with a large avoidance gap between modes of
the same azimuthal number.
