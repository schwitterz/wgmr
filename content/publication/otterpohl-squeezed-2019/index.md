abstract: Squeezed vacuum states enable optical measurements below the quantum limit
  and hence are a valuable resource for applications in quantum metrology and also
  quantum communication. However, most available sources require high pump powers
  in the milliwatt range and large setups that hinder real-world applications. Furthermore,
  degenerate operation of such systems presents a challenge. Here, we use a compact
  crystalline whispering gallery mode resonator made of lithium niobate as a degenerate
  parametric oscillator. We demonstrate about 1.4&#x00A0;dB noise reduction below
  the shot-noise level for only 300&#x00A0;&#x03BC;W of pump power in degenerate single-mode
  operation. Furthermore, we report a record pump threshold as low as 1.35&#x00A0;&#x03BC;W.
  Our results show that the whispering gallery-based approach presents a promising
  platform for a compact and efficient source for nonclassical light.
