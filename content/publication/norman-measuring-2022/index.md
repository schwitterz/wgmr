abstract: The fabrication of a yttrium orthosilicate (YSO) whispering gallery mode
  (WGM) resonator is described, displaying quality (Q)-factors as high as 1.1 × 109.
  An overview of the experimental setup is presented including the procedure for spatial
  and spectral characterisation of the WGMs. We consider the optical losses present
  in such a resonator and what steps were taken in order to minimise these losses.
  The surface scattering in such a resonator is considered and we show that in the
  wavelength range of 1.5 μm, the Q-factor is not limited by scattering losses for
  the case in which surface inhomogeneities are weakly correlated. The high Q-factors
  we demonstrate have implications for rare earth ion dopant based quantum technologies
  because YSO is an important host material for these applications.
