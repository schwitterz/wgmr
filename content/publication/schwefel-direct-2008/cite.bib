 abstract = {We report a precise direct measurement of the Goos-Hänchen shift after one reflection off a dielectric interface coated with periodic metal stripes. The spatial displacement of the shift is determined by image analysis. A maximal absolute shift of 5.18 and 23.39 μm for TE and TM polarized light, respectively, is determined. This technique is simple to implement and can be used for a large range of incident angles.},
