abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated the generation of widely spaced parametric
  sidebands that can evolve into &#x201C;clustered&#x201D; optical frequency combs
  in Kerr microresonators. Here we describe the physics that underpins the formation
  of such clustered comb states. In particular, we show that the phase matching required
  for the initial sideband generation is such that (at least) one of the sidebands
  experiences anomalous dispersion, enabling the sideband to drive frequency comb
  formation via degenerate and non-degenerate four-wave mixing. We validate our proposal
  through a combination of experimental observations made in a magnesium-fluoride
  microresonator and corresponding numerical simulations. We also investigate the
  coherence properties of the resulting clustered frequency combs. Our findings provide
  valuable insights on the generation and dynamics of widely spaced parametric sidebands
  and clustered frequency combs in Kerr microresonators.
