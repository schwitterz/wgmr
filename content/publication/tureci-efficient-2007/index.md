abstract: A numerically efficient Fredholm formulation of the billiard problem is
  presented. The standard solution in the framework of the boundary integral method
  in terms of a search for roots of a secular determinant is reviewed first. We next
  reformulate the singularity condition in terms of a flow in the space of an auxiliary
  one-parameter family of eigenproblems and argue that the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions
  are analytic functions within a certain domain. Based on this analytic behavior,
  we present a numerical algorithm to compute a range of billiard eigenvalues and
  associated eigenvectors by only two diagonalizations.
