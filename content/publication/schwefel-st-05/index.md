abstract: "Dielectric microcavities based on cylindrical and deformed cylindrical
  shapes have been employed as resonators for microlasers. Such systems support spiral
  resonances with finite momentum along the cylinder axis. For such modes the boundary
  conditions do not separate, and simple TM and TE polarization states do not exist.
  We formulate a theory for the dispersion relations and polarization properties of
  such resonances for an infinite dielectric rod of arbitrary cross section and then
  solve for these quantities for the case of a circular cross section (cylinder).
  Useful analytic formulas are obtained using the eikonal (Einstein-Brillouin-Keller)
  method, which are shown to be excellent approximations to the exact results from
  the wave equation. The major finding is that the polarization of the radiation emitted
  into the far field is linear up to a polarization critical angle (PCA) at which
  it changes to elliptical. The PCA always lies between the Brewster's and total-internal-reflection
  angles for the dielectric, as is shown by an analysis based on the Jones matrices
  of the spiraling rays. (c) 2005 Optical Society of America. "
