 abstract = {Dielectric microcavities based on cylindrical and
deformed cylindrical shapes have been employed as resonators for
microlasers. Such systems support spiral resonances with finite
momentum along the cylinder axis. For such modes the boundary
conditions do not separate, and simple TM and TE polarization
states do not exist. We formulate a theory for the dispersion
relations and polarization properties of such resonances for an
infinite dielectric rod of arbitrary cross section and then solve
for these quantities for the case of a circular cross section
(cylinder). Useful analytic formulas are obtained using the eikonal
(Einstein-Brillouin-Keller) method, which are shown to be excellent
approximations to the exact results from the wave equation. The
major finding is that the polarization of the radiation emitted
into the far field is linear up to a polarization critical angle
(PCA) at which it changes to elliptical. The PCA always lies
between the Brewster's and total-internal-reflection angles for the
dielectric, as is shown by an analysis based on the Jones matrices
of the spiraling rays. (c) 2005 Optical Society of America.
