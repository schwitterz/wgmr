abstract: We present our experiments on refractometric sensing with ultrahigh-Q, crystalline,
  birefringent magnesium fluoride (MgF_2) whispering gallery mode resonators. The
  difference to fused silica which is most commonly used for sensing experiments is
  the small refractive index of MgF2 which is very close to that of water. Compared
  to fused silica this leads to more than 50% longer evanescent fields and a 4.25
  times larger sensitivity. Moreover the birefringence amplifies the sensitivity difference
  between TM and TE type modes which will enhance sensing experiments based on difference
  frequency measurements. We estimate the performance of our resonators and compare
  them with fused silica theoretically and present experimental data showing the interferometrically
  measured evanescent field decay and the sensitivity of mm-sized MgF_2 whispering
  gallery mode resonators immersed in water. These data show reasonable agreement
  with the developed theory. Furthermore, we observe stable Q factors in water well
  above 1 Ã— 10^8.
