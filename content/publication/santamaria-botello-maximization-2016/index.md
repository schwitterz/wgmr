abstract: In this paper, a detailed description of the optical coupling into a Whispering
  Gallery Mode (WGM) resonator through a prism via frustrated total internal reflection
  (FTIR) is presented. The problem is modeled as three media with planar interfaces
  and closed expressions for FTIR are given. Then, the curvature of the resonator
  is taken into account and the mode overlap is theoretically studied. A new analytical
  expression giving the optimal geometry of a disc-shaped or ring-shaped resonator
  for maximizing the intra-cavity circulating power is presented. Such expression
  takes into consideration the spatial distribution of the WGM at the surface of the
  resonator, thus being more accurate than the currently used expressions. It also
  takes into account the geometry of the prism. It is shown an improvement in the
  geometry values used with the current expressions of about 30%. The reason why the
  pump laser signal can be seen in experiments under critical coupling is explained
  on this basis. Then, the conditions required for exciting the highest possible optical
  power inside the resonator are obtained. The aim is to achieve a highly-efficient
  up-conversion of a THz signal into the optical domain via the second-order nonlinearity
  of the resonator material.
