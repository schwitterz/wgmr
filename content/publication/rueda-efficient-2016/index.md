abstract: Linking classical microwave electrical circuits to the optical telecommunication
  band is at the core of modern communication. Future quantum information networks
  will require coherent microwave-to-optical conversion to link electronic quantum
  processors and memories via low-loss optical telecommunication networks. Efficient
  conversion can be achieved with electro-optical modulators operating at the single
  microwave photon level. In the standard electro-optic modulation scheme, this is
  impossible because both up- and down-converted sidebands are necessarily present.
  Here, we demonstrate true single-sideband up- or down-conversion in a triply resonant
  whispering gallery mode resonator by explicitly addressing modes with asymmetric
  free spectral range. Compared to previous experiments, we show a 3 orders of magnitude
  improvement of the electro-optical conversion efficiency, reaching 0.1% photon number
  conversion for a 10 GHz microwave tone at 0.42 mW of optical pump power. The presented
  scheme is fully compatible with existing superconducting 3D circuit quantum electrodynamics
  technology and can be used for nonclassical state conversion and communication.
  Our conversion bandwidth is larger than 1 MHz and is not fundamentally limited.
