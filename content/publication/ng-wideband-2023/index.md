abstract: Parametric oscillation in Kerr microresonators provides an attractive pathway
  for the generation of new optical frequencies in a low-power, small-footprint device.
  The frequency shift of the newly generated parametric sidebands is set by the phasematching
  of the underlying four-wave-mixing process, with the generation of large frequency
  shift sidebands typically placing exacting requirements on a resonator&#x2019;s
  dispersion profile. In practice, this limits the range of viable pump wavelengths,
  and ultimately the range of output frequencies. In this paper, we consider a multimode
  four-wave-mixing process in which the pump and sidebands propagate in different
  mode families of the resonator. We show that this multimode configuration yields
  a considerable relaxation in the phasematching requirements needed to generate large
  frequency shift parametric sidebands, allowing their formation even in resonators
  with strong second-order dispersion. Experimentally we use a magnesium-fluoride
  micro-disk resonator to demonstrate this multimode phasematching. By accessing different
  pump and sideband modes, four distinct multimode parametric processes generating
  frequency shifts between 118 and 216 THz are reported. The resulting separation
  between the two sidebands is almost three octaves.
