abstract: As the field of terahertz (THz) photonics advances, we present a monolithic
  gallium arsenide (GaAs) disk-shaped whispering gallery mode resonator that has potential
  as a component in THz nonlinear optics. GaAs is a material with significant optical
  nonlinearity which can be enhanced when the crystal is shaped into a microdisk resonator.
  A 4-mm-disk-resonator was fabricated using single-point diamond turning and was
  characterized to obtain a quality (Q) factor of 2.21k at ∼150 GHz and 1.41k at ∼300
  GHz. We also demonstrated the blue-shifting of up to ∼0.3 GHz of the THz modes using
  a block of metal. This post-fabrication degree of freedom could be useful for phase-matching
  requirements for nonlinear optical processes, such as detection based on optical
  up-conversion of THz radiation. This proof-of-concept demonstration can pave the
  way for the implementation of a compact, tunable and efficient device which could
  be integrated into nonlinear photonic platforms for THz generation, manipulation
  and detection.
