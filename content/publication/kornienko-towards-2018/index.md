abstract: We study a calibration scheme for terahertz wave nonlinear-optical detectors
  based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Contrary to the usual low wavelength
  pump in the green, we report here on the observation of spontaneous parametric down-conversion
  originating from an in-growth poled lithium niobate crystal pumped with a continuous
  wave 50 mW, 795 nm diode laser system, phase-matched to a terahertz frequency idler
  wave. Such a system is more compact and allows for longer poling periods as well
  as lower losses in the crystal. Filtering the pump radiation by a rubidium-87 vapor
  cell allowed the frequency-angular spectra to be obtained down to ∼0.5 THz or ∼1
  nm shift from the pump radiation line. The presence of an amplified spontaneous
  emission “pedestal” in the diode laser radiation spectrum significantly hampers
  the observation of spontaneous parametric down-conversion spectra, in contrast to
  conventional narrowband gas lasers. Benefits of switching to longer pump wavelengths
  are pointed out, such as collinear optical-terahertz phase-matching in bulk crystals.
