abstract: Conversion of microwave radiation into the optical range has been predicted
  to reach unity quantum efficiency in whispering-gallery resonators made from an
  optically nonlinear crystal and supporting microwave and optical modes simultaneously.
  In this work, we theoretically explore and experimentally demonstrate a resonator
  geometry that can provide the required phase matching for such a conversion at any
  desired frequency in the sub-THz range. We show that such a ring-shaped resonator
  not only allows for the phase matching but also maximizes the overlap of the interacting
  fields. As a result, unity-efficient conversion is expected in a resonator with
  feasible parameters.
