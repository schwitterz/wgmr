abstract: We introduce a method for optically detected magnetic resonance for atomlike
  systems in an optical resonator. Driving the spin transitions of these systems with
  microwaves causes changes to the populations of the ground-state spin levels, which
  we detect by changes in the optical cavity frequency. The technique is useful for
  characterizing experiments aimed at quantum microwave-to-optical transduction because
  it provides a way of only probing the spin transitions of the atomlike systems that
  are in the optical resonator's mode. We demonstrate the technique using a cryogenic
  erbium-doped whispering-gallery-mode resonator inside a microwave resonator. We
  compare our results with more standard electron paramagnetic resonance to show that
  our optical modes are confined to a region of large microwave magnetic-field amplitude.
  Our optical modes have a Q factor better than 108 making them the highest Q-factor
  resonators studied with cryogenic rare-earth-ion dopants, allowing us to report
  ensemble strong coupling between the erbium dopants and an optical whispering-gallery-mode
  resonator.
