abstract: Quantum information technology strongly relies on the coupling of optical
  photons with narrowband quantum systems, such as quantum dots, color centers, and
  atomic systems. This coupling requires matching the optical wavelength and bandwidth
  to the desired system, which presents a considerable problem for most available
  sources of quantum light. Here we demonstrate the coupling of alkali dipole transitions
  with a tunable source of photon pairs. Our source is based on spontaneous parametric
  downconversion in a triply resonant whispering gallery mode resonator. For this,
  we have developed novel wavelength-tuning mechanisms that allow a coarse tuning
  to either the cesium or rubidium wavelength, with subsequent continuous fine-tuning
  to the desired transition. As a demonstration of the functionality of the source,
  we performed a heralded single-photon measurement of the atomic decay. We present
  a major advance in controlling the spontaneous downconversion process, which makes
  our bright source of heralded single photons now compatible with a plethora of narrowband
  resonant systems.
