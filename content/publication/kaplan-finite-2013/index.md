abstract: We present an optical mode solver for a whispering gallery resonator coupled
  to an adjacent arbitrary shaped nano-particle that breaks the axial symmetry of
  the resonator. Such a hybrid resonator-nanoparticle is similar to what was recently
  used for bio-detection and for field enhancement. We demonstrate our solver by parametrically
  studying a toroid-nanoplasmonic device and get the optimal nano-plasmonic size for
  maximal enhancement. We investigate cases near a plasmonic resonance as well as
  far from a plasmonic resonance. Unlike common plasmons that typically benefit from
  working near their resonance, here working far from plasmonic resonance provides
  comparable performance. This is because the plasmonic resonance enhancement is accompanied
  by cavity quality degradation through plasmonic absorption.
