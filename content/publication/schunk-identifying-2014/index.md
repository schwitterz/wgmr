abstract: Identifying the mode numbers in whispering-gallery mode resonators (WGMRs)
  is important for tailoring them to experimental needs. Here we report on a novel
  experimental mode analysis technique based on the combination of frequency analysis
  and far-field imaging for high mode numbers of large WGMRs. The radial mode numbers
  q and the angular mode numbers p = ℓ-m are identified and labeled via far-field
  imaging. The polar mode numbers ℓ are determined unambiguously by fitting the frequency
  differences between individual whispering gallery modes (WGMs). This allows for
  the accurate determination of the geometry and the refractive index at different
  temperatures of the WGMR. For future applications in classical and quantum optics,
  this mode analysis enables one to control the narrow-band phase-matching conditions
  in nonlinear processes such as second-harmonic generation or parametric down-conversion.
