abstract: We present a numerically improved multipole formulation for the calculation
  of resonances of multiple disks located at arbitrary positions in a 2-d plane, and
  suitable for the accurate computation of the resonances of large numbers of disks
  and of high-wavenumber eigenstates. Using a simple reformulation of the field expansions
  and boundary conditions, we are able to transform the multipole formalism into a
  linear eigenvalue problem, for which fast and accurate methods are available. Observing
  that the motion of the eigenvalues in the complex plane is analytic with respect
  to a two parameter family, we present a numerical algorithm to compute a range of
  multiple-disk resonances and field distributions using only two diagonalizations.
  This method can be applied to photonic molecules, photonic crystals, photonic crystal
  fibers, and random lasers.
