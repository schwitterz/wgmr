abstract: Titanium doped sapphire (Ti:sapphire) is a laser gain material with broad
  gain bandwidth benefiting from the material stability of sapphire. These favorable
  characteristics of Ti:sapphire have given rise to femtosecond lasers and optical
  frequency combs. Shaping a single Ti:sapphire crystal into a millimeter sized high
  quality (Q) whispering gallery mode resonator (Q ≈ 108) reduces the lasing threshold
  to 14.2 mW and increases the laser slope efficiency to 34%. The observed lasing
  can be both multi-mode and single-mode. This is the first demonstration of a Ti:sapphire
  whispering-gallery laser. Furthermore, a novel method of evaluating the gain in
  Ti:sapphire in the near infrared region is demonstrated by introducing a probe laser
  with a central wavelength of 795 nm. This method results in decreasing linewidth
  of the modes excited with the probe laser, consequently increasing their Q. These
  findings open avenues for the usage of whispering gallery mode resonators as cavities
  for the implementation of compact Ti:sapphire lasers. Moreover, Ti:sapphire whispering-gallery
  laser can also be utilized as an amplifier inside its gain bandwidth by implementing
  a pump–probe configuration.
