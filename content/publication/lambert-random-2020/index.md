abstract: We use an artificial neural network to analyze asymmetric noisy random telegraph
  signals, and extract underlying transition rates. We demonstrate that a long short-term
  memory neural network can outperform other methods, particularly for noisy signals
  and measurements with limited bandwidths. Our technique gives reliable results as
  the signal-to-noise ratio approaches one, and over a wide range of underlying transition
  rates. We apply our method to random telegraph signals generated by quasiparticle
  poisoning in a superconducting double dot, allowing us to extend our measurement
  of quasiparticle dynamics to new temperature regimes.
