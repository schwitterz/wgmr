abstract: We propose a dielectric rod waveguide antenna (DRW) integrated with a photomixer
  as a THz emitter. This represents a different approach as opposed to the classical
  solution of a substrate lens. Main goals are an inexpensive alternative to substrate
  lenses, reduction of both reflections on the semiconductor-air interface and scattering
  of terahertz-generated power into the substrate. A radiation pattern measured at
  137 GHz is shown as a proof-of-concept. In order to increase radiated power, the
  improvement of the rod antenna is discussed. Finally, as an application example,
  evanescent coupling of the DRW into a high index whispering gallery mode resonator
  is shown.
