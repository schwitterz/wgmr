 abstract = {We propose a dielectric rod waveguide antenna (DRW) integrated with a photomixer as a THz emitter. This represents a different approach as opposed to the classical solution of a substrate lens. Main goals are an inexpensive alternative to substrate lenses, reduction of both reflections on the semiconductor-air interface and scattering of terahertz-generated power into the substrate. A radiation pattern measured at 137 GHz is shown as a proof-of-concept. In order to increase radiated power, the improvement of the rod antenna is discussed. Finally, as an application example, evanescent coupling of the DRW into a high index whispering gallery mode resonator is shown.},
