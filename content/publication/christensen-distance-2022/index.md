abstract: In this work, we analyze the first whispering gallery mode resonator (WGMR)
  made from monocrystalline yttrium lithium fluoride (YLF). The disc-shaped resonator
  is fabricated using single-point diamond turning and exhibits a high intrinsic quality
  factor (Q) of 8×108. Moreover, we employ a novel, to the best of our knowledge,
  method based on microscopic imaging of Newton&#x2019;s rings through the back of
  a trapezoidal prism. This method can be used to evanescently couple light into a
  WGMR and monitor the separation between the cavity and the coupling prism. Accurately
  calibrating the distance between a coupling prism and a WGMR is desirable as it
  can be used to improve experimental control and conditions, i.e., accurate coupler
  gap calibration can aid in tuning into desired coupling regimes and can be used
  to avoid potential damage caused by collisions between the coupling prism and the
  WGMR. Here, we use two different trapezoidal prisms together with the high-Q YLF
  WGMR to demonstrate and discuss this method.
