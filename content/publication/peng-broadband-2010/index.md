abstract: We report on a novel type of Bi-doped crystal that exhibits ultrabroadband
  photoluminescence in the near infrared (NIR). Emission centers can be generated
  and degenerated reversibly by annealing the material in CO atmosphere and air, respectively,
  indicating that emission is related to the presence of Bi-species in low valence
  states. Correlating static and dynamic excitation and emission data with the size
  and charge of available lattice sites suggests that two types of Bi0-species, each
  located on one of the two available Ba2+ lattice sites, are responsible for NIR
  photoemission. This is further confirmed by the absence of NIR emission in polycrystalline
  Ca2P2O7:Bi and Sr2P2O7:Bi. Excitation is assigned to transitions between the doubly
  degenerated ground state 4S3/2 and the degenerated excited levels 2D3/2, 2D5/2 and
  2P1/2, respectively. NIR emission is attributed to 2D3/2→4S3/2. The NIR emission
  center can coexist with Bi2+ species. Then, also Bi2+ is accommodated on one of
  the two Ba2+-sites. Energy transfer between Bi2+ ions occurs within a critical distance
  of 25.9 Å.
