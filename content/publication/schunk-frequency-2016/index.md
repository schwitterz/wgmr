abstract: Quantum repeaters rely on interfacing flying qubits with quantum memories.
  The most common implementations include a narrowband single photon matched in bandwidth
  and central frequency to an atomic system. Previously, we demonstrated the compatibility
  of our versatile source of heralded single photons, which is based on parametric
  down-conversion in a triply resonant whispering-gallery mode resonator, with alkaline
  transitions [Schunk et al., Optica 2015, 2, 773]. In this paper, we analyse our
  source in terms of phase matching, available wavelength-tuning mechanisms and applications
  to narrowband atomic systems. We resonantly address the D1 transitions of caesium
  and rubidium with this optical parametric oscillator pumped above its oscillation
  threshold. Below threshold, the efficient coupling of single photons to atomic transitions
  heralded by single telecom-band photons is demonstrated. Finally, we present an
  accurate analytical description of our observations. Providing the demonstrated
  flexibility in connecting various atomic transitions with telecom wavelengths, we
  show a promising approach to realize an essential building block for quantum repeaters.
