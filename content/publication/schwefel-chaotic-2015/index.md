abstract: Lasers appear to be ideal light sources for a variety of projection and
  imaging systems because of their spectral brightness and their ability to produce
  a beam of light that can be tightly collimated to travel long distances. Lasers
  owe these extraordinary properties to a quality called coherence. Yet, lasers are
  not widely used in imaging and projection applications, because the coherence of
  laser light is just too extreme. Spatiotemporal coherence of the imaging source
  leads to artifacts such as speckle, caused by the uncontrolled scattering of laser
  light and multipath interference that degrade the image considerably. Redding et
  al. (1) now report how a semiconductor laser based on a chaotic cavity can offer
  a “compact” solution to this problem. The availability of such low-cost, on-chip
  semiconductor lasers and the possibility to electrically modulate them make such
  lasers attractive light sources for a variety of applications, ranging from compact
  projectors to optical coherence tomography.
