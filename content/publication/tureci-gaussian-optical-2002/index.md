abstract: The quasi-bound modes localized on stable periodic ray orbits of dielectric
  micro-cavities are constructed in the short-wavelength limit using the parabolic
  equation method. These modes are shown to coexist with irregularly spaced �??chaotic�??
  modes for tHarald G.neric case. The wavevector quantization rule for the quasi-bound
  modes is derived and given a simple physical interpretation in terms of Fresnel
  reflection; quasi-bound modes are explictly constructed and compared to numerical
  results. The effect of discrete symmetries of the resonator is analyzed and shown
  to give rise to quasi-degenerate multiplets; the average splitting of these multiplets
  is calculated by methods from quantum chaos theory.
