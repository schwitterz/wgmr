abstract: We demonstrate a method to perform spectroscopy of near-infrared single
  photons without the need of dispersive elements. This method is based on a photon
  energy resolving transition edge sensor and is applied for the characterization
  of widely wavelength tunable narrow-band single photons emitted from a crystalline
  whispering gallery mode resonator. We measure the emission wavelength of tnerated
  signal and idler photons with an uncertainty of up to 2 nm.
