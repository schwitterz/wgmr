abstract: Photon pairs and heralded single photons, obtained from cavity-assisted
  parametric down conversion (PDC), play an important role in quantum communications
  and technology. This motivated a thorough study of the spectral and temporal properties
  of parametric light, both above the optical parametric oscillator (OPO) threshold,
  where the semiclassical approach is justified, and deeply below it, where the linear
  cavity approximation is applicable. The pursuit of a higher two-photon emission
  rate leads into an interesting intermediate regime, between above OPO threshold
  and very low pump power, where the OPO still operates considerably below the threshold
  but the nonlinear cavity phenomena cannot be neglected anymore. Here, we investigate
  this intermediate regime and show that the spectral and temporal properties of the
  photon pairs, as well as their emission rate, may significantly differ from the
  widely accepted linear model. The observed phenomena include frequency pulling and
  broadening in the temporal correlation for the down-converted optical fields. These
  factors need to be taken into account when devising practical applications of the
  high-rate cavity-assisted spontaneous PDC sources.
