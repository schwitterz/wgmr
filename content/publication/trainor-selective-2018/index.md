abstract: We demonstrate second-harmonic generation (SHG) in an x-cut congruent lithium
  niobate (LN) whispering-gallery mode (WGM) resonator. First, we show theoretically
  that independent control of the coupling of the pump and signal modes is optimal
  for high conversion rates. A coupling scheme based on our earlier work [F. Sedlmeir
  et al., Phys. Rev. Applied 7, 024029 (2017)] is then implemented experimentally
  to verify this improvement. Thereby, we are able to improve on the efficiency of
  SHG by more than an order of magnitude by selectively outcoupling using a LN prism,
  utilizing the birefringence of it and the resonator in kind. This method is also
  applicable to other nonlinear processes in WGM resonators.
